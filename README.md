# Data-Integration-and-Analysis-with-Jupyter-APIs-and-SQL

#Project Overview:

In this project, I enhanced my data analytics skills by integrating datasets into Jupyter notebooks using APIs, handling Python-SQL connections,
cleansing data with Pandas, and crafting SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. This comprehensive project aimed to strengthen my foundational knowledge 
and practical abilities in data manipulation and analysis.

# Key Learning Objectives:

How to Get Dataset into Jupyter with API:
Seamlessly integrated datasets into Jupyter notebooks using APIs.
Established a strong foundation for data projects by understanding how to fetch and handle data programmatically.

Library to Handle Connection of Python and SQL:
Learned essential libraries and Developed skills in data manipulation and querying by efficiently connecting Python scripts to SQL databases.

Pandas Data Cleansing:
Mastered the art of data cleansing using Pandas.
Ensured data accuracy and readiness for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.

SQL Query to Get Answrs to the questions:
Crafted SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.
Transformed raw information into actionable intelligence, enabling informed decision-making.

# 🏆 Project Highlights:
